# Stagemix ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º

## Description
This is StageMix, a card game where players compete to form the best k-pop group. The
game uses a custom deck created by Lindsay Blocker and her brother.


### Idol Card

<br />

Each card has the following attributes:
<br />

**Score** - An idol's cumulative rating across all categories: dance, vocal,
visual, personality, and stage presence.
<br />

**Ability** - An idol's unique ability (vocalist, dancer, visual, personality or
all-rounder) represented by the color of the card.
<br />

**Rank** - Idols are ranked from C tier up to S
tier. This lets the player quickly see the value of each card
during the game.

A stage card sets the field effects of each
round. They represent the event that each team
will be judged on.
<br />
<br />
Cards with an
ability that is highlighted by the
stage cards will be granted bonus
points. For example, Chaeryeongâ€™s score
would become a 10.4 because of the two
point boost that the Award Show Stage
Card grants dancers.
<br />
<br />
There are nine
stage cards: Award Show, Meet & Greet,
Comeback Stage, Acting Gig, SBS Radio,
Variety Show, Yeolâ€™s Sketchbook, Show
Me the Money, Studio Choom, and Solo.

### Gameplay

<br />

At the beginning of a round, a random stage card is chosen. Then each
player will draw five cards facing down. Every turn, the players are
allowed to make one of three moves: flip a card, draw a card, or
discard a card. The player must always have exactly five cards in
their deck. The game will progress until a player flips over their
last card. Once all cards are revealed, the total score will be
calculated and the player with the highest total score wins the
round.

## Installation
1. Download Unity Hub and Unity itself (Version 2021.2.31f)
2. Clone the stagemix Git Repository onto your computer.
3. When opening Unity Hub, click Open Remote Project and choose
the stagemix folder
4. If Mirror is not installed yet, download it through the Unity
Asset Store
5. To play two-player, press Command-B (Control-B on Windows) and
choose a name for your build
6. Once the client is built, press play on the Unity interface
7. Choose which screen will be the Host and which will be the

8. Have Fun!

Please contact me if there are any version errors with Unity and
Mirror. One troubleshooting tactic that usually works is reimporting
all assets under the Assets tab if there is an unreadable compile
error. If you save the game with a compile error, do now leave safe
mode or else the prefabs and scripts will be separated and you will
have to manually reattach them.
